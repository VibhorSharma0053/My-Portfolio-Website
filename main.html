                I am Vibhor Sharma, a passionate web developer currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer
                Science with a specialization in Data Science. With a strong foundation in front-end technologies like

                skills extend to building clean, modular, and maintainable code, ensuring seamless user experiences
                across various platforms. I have a deep interest in developing dynamic web applications that solve
                real-world problems and make digital interactions more engaging. <br><br>

                I am continuously expanding my expertise by learning new frameworks and tools, while also improving my
                knowledge of web design principles and best practices. As a web developer, I strive to stay up to date
                with industry trends and technologies to deliver modern, efficient, and visually appealing websites.
                Along with my development skills, I possess strong problem-solving abilities, attention to detail, and a
                commitment to writing high-quality code. I am eager to collaborate on exciting projects and contribute
                to creating innovative web solutions.
